# Discrete Adjoints of High-Order Time-Stepping Methods
Partial MATLAB implementation of the discrete adjoint methods for various high-order time-stepping methods with application to PDEs.

This repository only includes first-order adjoints, second-order adjoints will be included at a future date (although not any time soon).
